* [libzypp/zypper](http://en.opensuse.org/Libzypp) is an RPM frontend written in C/C++ (used by openSUSE, SLES and Ark Linux). It uses [SAT solver](https://github.com/openSUSE/libsolv) for dependency solving.
* [DNF](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/dnf) is an RPM frontend written in Python. It uses [SAT solver](https://github.com/openSUSE/libsolv) for the hard work.
