* Support for both RPM v4 and v6 packages (see [Compatibility Notes]({{ site.url }}/releases/6.0.0#compatibility-notes))
* Support for multiple OpenPGP signatures per package (#3385)
* Support for OpenPGP v6 and PQC keys and signatures (#3363)
* Support for updating previously imported keys (#2577)
* Support for installing RPM v3 packages has been removed (#1107)
* RPM defaults to enforcing signature checking (#1573)
* RPM uses the full key ID or fingerprint to identify OpenPGP keys everywhere (#2403)
* Man page and other documentation overhaul (#3612, #3669, #3751)
* Pristine and verifiable release tarballs (#3565) (#2702)

### General Use
* Several enhancements to *rpmkeys*(8):
  * `rpmkeys --import` can now be used to update keys (#2577).
    This also updates the key handle from a short ambiguous key id to
    full fingerprint.
  * `rpmkeys --import` now also works from a pipe
  * `rpmkeys --export` added for exporting keys
  * `rpmkeys --checksig`, `--list`, `--delete` use and expect full
    fingerprint of the keys (#3360)
  * `rpmkeys` works identically with all keystore backends
  * `rpmkeys --rebuild` can be used to rebuild the keystore contents and
     move between different keystore backends (#3347)
  * `rpmkeys` key lookup is now case-insensitive
* Several enhancements to *rpmsign*(1):
  * `rpmsign` can use either GnuPG or Sequoia-sq for signing (controlled
    by `%_openpgp_sign` macro (`gpg` or `sq`))
  * `rpmsign --addsign` no longer replaces existing signatures. Arbitrary
    number of signatures can be added on v6 packages by default and
    on v4 packages, with `--rpmv6`
  * `rpmsign --resign` replaces all existing signatures with a new one
* New query tag extensions (e.g. with `--qf <format>`):
  * `rpmformat` for determining package format version (3/4/6)
  * `openpgp` for managing all supported OpenPGP signature types
* New query formatter `:hashalgo` for displaying hash algorithm names
* New `--filemime` query alias for querying per-file MIME info
* Consistent terminology and case usage in signature and key messages
  * OpenPGP signatures are called OpenPGP in output
  * RPM v3 header+payload signatures are called "legacy" in output
* New feature to calculate a set of configurable digests on verification
  and safe them in the rpmdb. This can help identifying the originating
  package file. (RHEL-35619)
* Fix scriptlet errors not reflected in transaction result code (#2581)
* Fix `%triggerprein` and `%triggerun` not failing the associated
  install/erase operation (#3815)
* Fix `--hash`, `--percent` and `--test` not working with `--restore` (#3917)
* Fix a segfault and memory leaks in *rpmgraph*(1) (#3925)
* Fix *rpm2archive*(1) using the same suffix for tar and cpio (#3922)
* Man page overhaul (WIP):
  * Update all manual pages to a new consistent style with examples (#3669)
  * Add man pages for all major components and file formats (#3612)
    * *rpm-config*(5)
    * *rpm-rpmrc*(5)
    * *rpm-macrofile*(5)
    * *rpm-manifest*(5)
    * *rpm-lua*(7)
    * *rpm-macros*(7)
    * *rpm-payloadflags*(7)
    * *rpm-queryformat*(7)
    * *rpm-version*(7)
    * *rpmuncompress*(1)
  * Move end-user commands to section 1

* Versioned documentation on <https://rpm.org/docs/>
  * Man pages
  * Reference manual
  * API docs

### Packaging

### Building RPM
* A C++20 compiler is now required in addition to a C99 compiler, but
  C++20 modules support is not required.
* rpm-sequoia >= 1.9.0 is now required for building with Sequoia (default)
* Python >= 3.10 is now required for building the Python bindings
* [scdoc](https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/scdoc) man page generator is now
  required for building RPM
* Pre-built API documentation is no longer shipped in the release tarballs.
  Building it is optional, but [Doxygen](https://github.com/doxygen/)
  is required for doing so. Pre-built API documentation for all releases
  can be found in <https://ftp.rpm.org/api/>

### Compatibility Notes
#### Package format
* New RPM v6 package format
  * All file sizes and related limits are 64bit
  * Crypto modernization
    * Obsolete crypto (MD5 and SHA1) dropped
    * SHA3-256 header digest added (#3797)
    * SHA512 and SHA3-256 payload digests added (#3642, #3894)
  * Per-file MIME info
  * Widely compatible with RPM >= 4.14
  * The "external" dependency generator mode no longer supported with
    v6 packages (#2373)
  * `rpmlib()` dependencies for pre-4.6 features removed to reduce clutter (#3854)
  * Can be queried with RPM >= 4.6
  * Can be unpacked with RPM >= 4.12
  * Can be verified and installed with RPM >= 4.14 (with caveats/limitations)
* RPM v4 packages:
  * Built packages are identical to those generated by RPM 4.x versions
  * Remain fully supported
  * In the default configuration, packages built with RPM < 4.14.0 cannot
    be verified due to their use of weak, obsolete MD5 and SHA1 digests.
    For strongly signed packages, this can be worked around by changing
    `%_pkgverify_level` to `signature` so the weak digests are simply ignored.
    If verifying the weak digests is necessary, the RPM 4.x behavior can
    be restored by setting `%_pkgverify_flags` to `0`.
* Support for installing RPM v3 packages has been removed. (#1107)
  They can still be queried and also unpacked with *rpm2cpio*(1).
* RPM defaults to building v6 packages, this can be changed with the
  `%_rpmformat` macro.
* Lua `posix.fork()` family of calls, deprecated in 4.20, is disabled in
  packages built with RPM >= 6.0. They continue to function in packages
  built by RPM <= 4.20 however.

#### Other
* Package signing key configuration differs from the past. To support
  other implementations besides GnuPG, the signer ID is now set via
  `%_openpgp_sign_id` macro, which defaults to `%{?_gpg_name}` for
  backwards compatibility.
* The low-level package signing macros are now parametric, any custom
  `%__gpg_sign_cmd` overrides will simply not work as such. Users are
  encouraged to look into dropping such overrides rather than just
  updating, most such overrides haven't been necessary in a long time.
* `%_passwd_path` and `%_group_path` are now treated as colon separated
  paths to allow using multiple files as the source of NSS information
  (e.g. with nss-altfiles)
* `--pkgid` and `--hdrid` query CLI-switches have been dropped (#2633)
