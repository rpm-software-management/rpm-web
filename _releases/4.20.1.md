* Support for fully locked user accounts in `sysusers.d(5)` files
* Filter Lua deprecation warnings based on the originating RPM version
* Fix regressions in *rpmsign*(8), *rpmspec*(8), `%debug_package` and more
* Fix unmodified `%config` (and possibly other) files being removed in case of unpack failure
* Fix IMA plugin causing transaction failures in rootless containers
* Fix sqlite rpmdb growing over time

#### Enhancements

* Packaging: Add support for [fully locked](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/13522) user accounts (via the new `u!` flag) in `sysusers.d(5)` files ([#3450](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3450)).
* Building: RPM release tarballs (`.tar.bz2`) are now generated in a reproducible and hermetic environment using GitHub Actions ([#2702](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2702)).

#### Fixes

* Command-Line: Fix a regression where *rpmsign*(8) could corrupt the packages on signing operations (affected RPM >= 4.18.1) ([#3469](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3469)).
* Command-Line: Fix a regression where *rpmspec*(8) would emit extra output in query mode for `BuildSystem` specs ([#3413](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3413)).
* Command-Line: Fix `rpmdb --exportdb` failing when the database is on read-only media ([#1266](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/1266)).
* Command-Line: Fix *rpmkeys*(8) failing when no keys are present in the keyring ([#3378](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3378)).
* Command-Line: It was possible to sign files in `.src.rpm` packages with *rpmsign*(8), which has been corrected. ([#3470](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3470)).
* Transactions: Fix unmodified `%config` files (and possibly more if `%_minimize_writes` is enabled) being removed in case of an unpack failure (affected RPM >= 4.14.0) ([#3284](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3284)).
* Transactions: Fix sqlite rpmdb growing over time ([#3309](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3309)).
* Transactions: Lua deprecation warnings were also shown for packages built with an RPM version where the functions weren't yet deprecated, which has been corrected ([#3270](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3270)).
* Transactions: Packages without `RPMTAG_ARCH` or `RPMTAG_OS` are not legitimate packages but were still possible to install, which has been corrected ([#3344](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3344)).
* Packaging: Fix a regression where manual invocation of `%debug_package` caused problems when invoked in spec files directly ([#3290](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3290)).
* Packaging: Fix a regression where an empty build directory was left behind on `rpmbuild -bs` ([#3382](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3382)).
* Packaging: Fix a regression in build-id generation from compressed ELF files ([#3463](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3463)).
* Packaging: Fix a race condition when running multiple *rpmbuild*(8) instances in parallel with a non-existent `%{_tmppath}` ([#3508](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3508)).
* Packaging: Fix symlinked `.la` files not getting removed from the buildroot ([#3304](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3304)).
* Packaging: Fix brp-strip in regex-unsafe buildroots ([#3492](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3492)).
* Plugins: Source packages triggered plugin hooks when unpacked with `rpm -i`, which has been corrected ([#3470](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3470)).
* Plugins: Don't let the IMA plugin fail the transaction if it's running in a rootless container where IMA isn't supported ([#3234](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3234)).
* Plugins: Fix unshare plugin failure when installing to a chroot ([#3187](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3187)).
* Configuration: When editing a macro file in place, the text editor may place a backup file (e.g. with the `~` suffix) in the same directory, causing RPM to load it at startup and possibly override the original macro definitions. To help prevent that, RPM now ignores filenames with non-alphanumeric characters when looking for macro files to load ([#3373](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3373)).
* Documentation: Man pages have seen various formatting and punctuation fixes ([#3511](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3511)).
