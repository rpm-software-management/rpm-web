### Internal improvements and cleanups

 * Major code cleanups to signature- and low-level header handling, rpmio operations and database backends
 * Numerous issues found by Clang-analyzer: unused code removed and potential segfaults fixed
 * Transaction dependency caching uses in-memory hash instead of temporary database, avoiding various chroot-related issues
 * Database files and indexes are opened with relative paths, avoiding issues with chroot ([RhBug:507309](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=507309) & others)
 * rpmdb index for Obsoletes added
 * Hardcoded and broken ldconfig-scriptlet interpreter optimization removed
 * Ensure RPMSENSE_RPMLIB is consistently set on rpmlib() dependencies everywhere
 * DNEVR string is generated lazily on rpmdsNEVR() calls instead of every rpmdsNext()
 * rpmal completely reimplemented with hashes for massive speedup
 * All NSS-dependencies and low-level signature verification have been pushed to librpmio
 * Handle errors in rpmDigestDup() correctly
 * Remember hash algorithm in digest context
 * Signature check error code sanity: RPMRC_NOKEY always means "this could be fixed by importing the key", RPMRC_FAIL is "invalid signature"
 
### Lua interface
 * Make rpm.unregister() Lua extension actually work, and permit hook to unregister itself
 * Add rpm.b64encode() and rpm.b64decode() extensions for base64 encoding and decoding

### Python bindings
 * Major overhaul to modernize and cleanup the code, "pythonize" the interfaces
 * Review all exceptions raised from within rpm-python, revise as necessary
 * Split the C-level module into separate "runtime" and build modules to avoid hard dependency on librpmbuild
 * Preliminary support for Python 3.x (compiles, loads and works with limitations + caveats)
 * All rpm object types support sub-typing now (but with caveats)
 * Implementation for various things have been moved to pure Python where possible. Notably TransactionSet class is by default a pure Python object, inherited from the C-level class
 * All functions and methods accepting file descriptors now accept any file-like objects implementing .fileno() method too
 * All functions and methods accepting strings now accept Unicode objects too (automatically converted to UTF-8 internally)
 * Various missing constants have been added (RPMDBI_LABEL, RPMSENSE_ANY, RPMRC-codes...)
 * Various memory leaks fixed

#### Generic utility functions
 * Export rpmlog() to Python as rpm.log() function
 * Support numeric expansion in rpm.expandMacro()

#### Header class
 * Support for (empty) header object creation and (limited) modification
 * Headers can be instanciated from file-like objects, unloaded header blobs (byte arrays) and from other headers (ie copied)
 * New header methods: .write(), .convert(), isSource()
 * Header .keys() method now returns all keys and is faster too
 * Support iterating over header objects

#### Transaction set class
 * addInstall() method now accepts any file-like objects and file names in addition to fd integers
 * addErase() method now accepts headers and match iterators in addition to labels and record numbers
 * Various transaction set flags and other attributes are exported directly as object attributes
 * New methods getKeyring() and setKeyring() permit manipulating transaction set keyring from Python, such as using a custom (non-rpmdb) keyring for signature verification

#### Dependency set class
 * All types of rpm.ds objects can now be created by calling rpm.ds constructor:
 * New method Compare() replaces former strange != syntax for determining dependency overlap

#### Spec class
 * Spec object instanciation has been decoupled from transaction objects and can now be directly instanciated by calling the spec constructor
 * Allow accessing spec package structures from Python (ticket [#14](http://rpm.org/ticket/14), [RhBug:46726](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=46726))
 * Former spec object methods have been converted to object attributes instead (incompatible)

#### New classes
 * Bindings for rpm keyring (rpm.keyring)
 * Bindings for pubkey types (rpm.pubkey)
 * Bindings for rpm problem objects has been added (rpm.prob)
 * File-object like bindings for rpm io interface (rpm.fd)

#### Deprecated and removed interfaces
 * rpm.headerLoad() is deprecated. Call header constructor instead.
 * hdr.expandFilelist() and hdr.compressFilelist() are deprecated. Use hdr.convert() instead.
 * hdr.dsOfHeader() and hdr.dsFromHeader() are deprecated. Call rpm.ds constructor instead.
 * rpm.ps (aka problem set) type has been removed, ts.problems() now returns a regular list object
 * mi.count() and ds.count() methods have been deprecated. Use len() instead.
 * Invalid tp_print methods have been removed (these were against Python recommedations)
 * Support for ambiguous and quirky cmp() and rich comparisons have been removed from rpm.ds objects
 * Support for ambiguous cmp() has been removed from header objects. Use rpm.versionCompare() instead.

### Build process
 * Fix building with binutils-gold (ticket [#107](http://rpm.org/ticket/107))
 * Fix out-of-tree build when Lua enabled (ticket [#91](http://rpm.org/ticket/91))
 * Linkage cleanups
