## Compatibility notes
* The method of building the RPM Python bindings using `setup.py` is now
  deprecated.  Distributions shipping RPM >= 4.18.1 and Python >= 3.12 are
  recommended to move to the autotools-native way (using the `--enable-python`
  configure option).  This is due to the removal of `distutils` in Python 3.12
  (see [PEP 632](https://peps.python.org/pep-0632/) for details).  While
  `setuptools` ships its own copy of `distutils`, unlike the original
  `distutils`, it generates egg-info data as directories, not files, which may
  interfere with later RPM upgrades or downgrades and cause file conflicts.  To
  compensate for the loss of egg-info after moving from `setup.py`, a custom
  egg-info file is now generated and installed during build with largely the
  same content as its `distutils` counterpart.
