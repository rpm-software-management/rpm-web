<dd>Bugs and enhancement requests for the "upstream" RPM can be filed in the <a href="http://rpm.org/newticket">rpm.org Trac</a>. Please search existing bug reports and RFE's to avoid filing duplicate entries. Note that you need to <a href="http://rpm.org/register">register</a> an account and ask for permissions being set for it on the mailing list or IRC channel in order to create tickets. Anonymous ticket creation is disabled as we'll want to be able to follow up on tickets with the reporter, and also to limit abuse.</dd>
