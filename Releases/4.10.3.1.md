# RPM 4.10.3.1 Release Notes



## Download information
 * [rpm-4.10.3.1.tar.bz2](http://rpm.org/releases/rpm-4.10.x/rpm-4.10.3.1.tar.bz2) source
 * SHA1SUM: b336cb1c28b43c061d2a0ce04decf3f013131a8b

## Summary of changes from RPM 4.10.3

Shortly after the release of RPM 4.10.3, a critical last-minute regression
in %ghost %config behavior was discovered and the 4.10.3 release was
pulled from downloads entirely as the regression could cause data loss:
4.10.3 could in some situations remove %ghost %config files
on package upgrades.  To protect the innocent, the potentially dangerous
4.10.3 release will not be reintroduced on rpm.org at all.

## General bugfixes and enhancements
 * Fix regression introduced in RPM 4.10.3 where %ghost %config files could
   get removed on package upgrade in some cases.
 * See [4.10.3 release notes](/wiki:Releases/4.10.3/) for other changes since
   rpm 4.10.2

## Build proces
 * Add test-cases for %ghost and %ghost %config behavior.
