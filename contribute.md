## How to contribute to rpm.org

### Source code

Our source code is maintained in a GitHub
[git repository](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm):

`git clone https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm.git`

### Web site

The rpm.org web site is maintained in [another git repository](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm-web) on GitHub:

`git clone https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm-web.git`

### Translations

Rpm is translated to non-English languages via
[Fedora Weblate instance](https://translate.fedoraproject.org/)

### Submitting changes

**When planning any non-trivial amount of work on rpm or the web-site,
please discuss it first on
[GitHub](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/discussions) or
the [rpm mailing lists](community) with the
rpm.org development team to avoid situations where efforts go wasted
because it's not in line with RPM design and goals.**

Do read our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) as the very first thing.

Write access can be granted for established contributors upon request, but
for most things sending patches to the
[rpm-maint mailing list](http://lists.rpm.org/mailman/listinfo/rpm-maint)
or creating a pull request on GitHub should be sufficient.

When sending patches, please use `git send-email` instead of any desktop
email clients.

### Where to start

Fixing existing bugs and known issues is always a good way to get started.
