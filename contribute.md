## How to contribute to rpm.org

### Source code

Our source code is maintained in a
[git repository](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm) at
[GitHub](https://github.com/):

`git clone https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm.git`

### Web site

The rpm.org web site is maintained in [another git repository](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm-web) on GitHub:

`git clone https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm-web.git`

### Submitting changes

Write access can be granted for established contributors upon request, but
for most things sending patches to the
[rpm-maint mailing list](http://lists.rpm.org/mailman/listinfo/rpm-maint)
or creating a pull request on GitHub should be sufficient.

When sending patches, please use `git send-email` instead of any desktop
email clients.

When planning on major changes to either code or web-site, please discuss
it first on the [rpm mailing lists](community) with the rpm.org development
team.

### Where to start

Fixing existing bugs and known issues is always a good way to get started.
Some pointers below:

* Upstream [issue tracker](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues)
