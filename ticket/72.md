Oops, forgot to format it properly:

    X: rpm: spelling-error-in-binary ./usr/lib/rpm/javadeps preceeded preceded
    X: rpm: spelling-error-in-binary ./usr/lib/rpm/javadeps specifing specifying
    X: rpm: spelling-error-in-binary ./usr/lib/rpm/javadeps capabilites capabilities

-   **status** changed from *new* to *closed*.
-   **resolution** set to *fixed*.
