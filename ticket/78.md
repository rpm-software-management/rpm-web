Allow noarch package to have architecture specific subpackages

### Description {#comment:description}

The reason for this request is simple. Scripting languages are mostly
architecture independent, but we sometimes have a special module that
has to be excluded from some archs.

The module itself is architecture independent, but it can utilize
component that is not present on some architectures (like grub on s390).
And we need to drop that dependency for the architecture in question.

But at the moment, the ifnarch and [ExcludeArch?](/ExcludeArch) tags do
not work with noarch packages and we can\'t change the subpackage to be
architecture specific since the main package is tagged as noarch.

Spliting the package in two would be a possible workaround, but it
wouldn\'t reflect the logic of dependencies. The subpackage is only
usable for the main package with corresponding version and moreover, the
subpackage is architecture independent and only the dependencies are
not.

Similar need for some Java packages that have JNI or some external C
dependencies in subpackages.

This would be very useful for [RubyGems?](/RubyGems).
[RubyGems?](/RubyGems) package is platform independent, however, it
needs to create folder structure for arch dependent gems. This directory
layout should go into platform dependent -filesystem subpackage.
Unfortunately, it is not possible without this feature. Thank you for
considering this RFE.
