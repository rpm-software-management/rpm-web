RFE: Handle \'\~\' in version/release to lower priority in rpmVersionCompare()

### Description {#comment:description}

It would be nice when a special handling of \'\~\' would be introduced
to mark \"negative\" version tokens. E.g. so that

\| foo-1.0\~beta \< foo-1.0

holds. This would simplify complicated rulesets which deal with such
naming schemes by abusing %release for it.

The patch 0001.diff was actually for 4.4.2, because someone had the
bright idea of making the master branch 4.4.2 instead of 4.7. Adding new
ones.

I finally (duh) got around to take a closer look at this, starting with
a test-suite for the vercmp() behavior to make it easier to test and
spot regressions.

For the simple case of eg 6.0 vs 6.0\~rc1 it seems to work as intended,
eg

     16: rpmvercmp(6.0~rc1, 6.0) = -1                    ok
     17: rpmvercmp(6.0~rc1, 6.0~rc1) = 0                 ok

but it doesn\'t handle multiple tildes correctly, these can\'t both be
right:

     18: rpmvercmp(6.0~rc1~git123, 6.0~rc1) = -1         ok
     19: rpmvercmp(6.0~rc1, 6.0~rc1~git123) = -1         ok

Since mirroring dpkg behavior seems the sensible thing to do here,
6.0\~rc1 should be considered newer than 6.0\~rc1\~git123 afaict.

Another thing that needs considering is handling compatibility, this
introduces a rather big change in rpm behavior. While recent rpm
versions reject tilde in version and release at build-time, there\'s a
huge installed base where that\'s not the case, and packages built with
those versions can have tilde in version/release and expecting a
completely different behavior.

It would be possible to add an rpmlib() dependency tracking for new
packages using the tilde syntax, that would prevent old rpm versions
from installing packages depending on the new semantics. However that
still leaves the problem of new rpm installing older packages which can
have tilde in version/release without meaning the new semantics. Fully
handling it would require rpmvercmp() taking a flag which semantics to
use\... which starts getting rather ugly.

This kind of solves the problem for rpm, although it seems pretty heavy
handed for just a change to the version comparison. But for anything
above rpm it doesn\'t help at all \... yum can\'t see those rpmlib when
it sees a version in primary or updateinfo or etc.

Well, in theory you\'d need two flags (one for each side of the test).
But if you did that then \_everything\_ that produced or consumed an
rpmversion would have to also produce/consume a flag. IMNSHO this isn\'t
going to happen.

If you are worried that there are significant rpms out there with \~ in
them, a much better fix is to just do the proposed \~ change but wait a
few years with the current \"\~ is invalid\" code in rpmbuild still on.
Or just don\'t change it :). No rpmlib and no flags, please.

rpmbuild \--allow-tilde :-) And later remove it again.
