### Description (Last modified by pmatilai) {#comment:description}

This doesn\'t seem particularly meaningful behavior (self-obsoleting
package):

    [root@dhcp102 noarch]# rpm -Uvh self-obsoletes-1.0-1.noarch.rpm 
    Preparing...                ########################################### [100%]
       1:self-obsoletes         ########################################### [100%]
    [root@dhcp102 noarch]# rpm -Uvh self-obsoletes-1.0-1.noarch.rpm 
    error: Failed dependencies:
        self-obsoletes is obsoleted by (installed) self-obsoletes-1.0-1.noarch
    [root@dhcp102 noarch]# 

..and neither is this (self-conflict on name or provide):

    [root@dhcp102 noarch]# rpm -Uvh self-conflict-1.0-1.noarch.rpm 
    error: Failed dependencies:
        self-conflict conflicts with self-conflict-1.0-1.noarch

At least for the self-conflict case, there\'s even a potentially
use-case for a \"singleton\" type packages:

Self obsoletes could just silently remove the package from the
transaction again. Packages added as erases by this package (as updated
or obsoleted) should stay in the transaction. That way it would be
possible to issue an update that removes a package from the system
without installing something else.

While it is possible to obsolete a package from another package for a)
the package got renames or b) is now part of another package it is not
possible to remove a package that is no longer necessary if there is no
other package taking care of that. An example could be a
driver/bugfix/workaround for a special hardware. Even if a later kernel
fixes the problem the kernel package might not obsolete the package -
may be because the distribution doesn\'t care or know.

-   **status** changed from *new* to *closed*.
-   **resolution** set to *fixed*.

This should be fixed as multiple improvement where done to both the
conflict and the obsolete handling code.
