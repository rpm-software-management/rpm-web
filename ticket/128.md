### Description {#comment:description}

The attached patch cleans up trailing whitespace, converts tabs to
spaces, does some other whitespace cleanups, and avoids some unnecessary
backslashes and parens in perl.prov and perl.req. This is just cleanup,
there are no functional changes.

There is still a remaining problem with this patch. The pattern in line
85 of perl.req will match anything starting with some kind of quote
character and ending with the same quote. But that might inappropriately
include some extra copies of the same quote. For instance, if the source
text in the file is:

    $make_frag .= <<'MAKE_FRAG' if $self->is_make_type('dmake');

then this is what will match and be treated as the tag:

    MAKE_FRAG' if $self->is_make_type('dmake

which is clearly not what what was intended. The string-content pattern
matching needs to be changed to be not-greedy:

    m/^\s*\$(?:.*)\s*=\s*<<\s*(["'`])(.*?)\1/

Hm, I don\'t see how it would be a problem with this patch - this patch
does not do any functional changes, it\'s just cleanup. This would be
closer (but the problem is not introduced by it either):
[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=362125&action=diff](https://web.archive.org/web/20151210102347/https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=362125&action=diff)

Anyway, your suggestion makes sense as a further improvement. I suppose
while at it the last parenthesis should be changed from \* to + because
something is always wanted between the quotes, ditto on the next line
for \\w, no?
