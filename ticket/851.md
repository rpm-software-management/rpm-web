### Description {#comment:description}

Running \'make check\' from tests/ when fakechroot is not available
produces many failed tests instead of informing that the testing
framework is incomplete.

Similarly, if rpm is build on a system wihtout xz-devel, some tests are
failing with even stranger errors (bad cpio header).

A possible solution is make \"make check\" fail immediately with an
explanation if either of those conditions are detected.
