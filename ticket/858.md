### Description {#comment:description}

With rpm 4.11.0-0.beta1.1.fc19:

    %doc doc/Users\ guide\ Apache.html

Gets executed as:

    + cp -pr 'doc/Users /builddir/build/BUILDROOT/rubygem-passenger-3.0.19-1.fc19.i386/usr/share/doc/mod_passenger-3.0.19'
    cp: missing destination file operand after 'doc/Users /builddir/build/BUILDROOT/rubygem-passenger-3.0.19-1.fc19.i386/usr/share/doc/mod_passenger-3.0.19'

Using:

    %doc 'doc/Users guide Apache.html'

doesn\'t work either:

    + cp -pr 'doc/Users $DOCDIR
    cp -pr guide $DOCDIR
    cp -pr Apache.html' /builddir/build/BUILDROOT/rubygem-passenger-3.0.19-1.fc19.x86_64/usr/share/doc/mod_passenger-3.0.19
    cp: cannot stat 'doc/Users $DOCDIR\ncp -pr guide $DOCDIR\ncp -pr Apache.html': No such file or directory

Hmph\... this is quite an ugly mess.

Single-quotation and backslash-escaping only ever \"worked\" in %doc by
happenstance, they aren\'t \*supposed\* to work, and do not work in
%files. What makes it so ugly is that the \"official\" way of
double-quoting has (AFAICT) never worked for special %doc files in
existing rpm versions, so people have been forced to look for \"whatever
works\" alternatives.

What I will do anyway is make double-quotation work for the special %doc
(and %license) directives, to make the %files list behavior consistent.

What to do with the rest is a bigger question mark: while its possible
to revert back to mostly \"traditional\" behavior for %doc, that would
open up the possibilities for nasty hacks (like passing arguments to
\"cp\") again. I\'d rather not go there. Another possibility would be
allowing single-quotation and backslash-escaping everywhere in %files,
but that has a bigger chance of breaking something else in turn and not
something I\'d want to do right before a stable release.

I\'m tempted to just fix the double-quotation and tell people to use
globs (the other \"official\" method) to workaround spaces in filenames
for %doc if compatibility across different versions of rpm is needed,
but maybe I\'d better sleep on it a bit.

I\'m happy with just about anything that would work. For me using ?
instead of \"\\ \" does the trick.

### 01/29/13 09:31:01 changed by pmatilai {#comment:4}

-   **status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*.
-   **resolution** set to *fixed*.
-   **milestone** set to *rpm-4.11.0*.

Okay, considering this fixed then: rpm \>= 4.11 only accepts
double-quoting and globbing for %doc (and %license), and rpm \>= 4.10.3
adds support for double-quoting (while remaining compatible with the old
hacks). Interoperability with older versions can be achieved with globs.
