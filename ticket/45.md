-   **status** changed from *new* to *assigned*.
-   **milestone** set to *rpm-4.9.0*.

This has been implemented in the macro engine itself as of commit
[49f99b86566bf71e1ebd8be4da29953aaf042b79](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/commit/49f99b86566bf71e1ebd8be4da29953aaf042b79 "Unsupported version control system "svn". Check that the Python bindings for "svn" are correctly installed.").
However the spec parser still uses the older expandMacros() API which is
limited by caller-specified preallocated buffer. As rpmExpand() doesn\'t
return error codes, a new API is needed to take advantage of the dynamic
buffer expansion in the spec parser.

### 01/05/11 06:54:40 changed by pmatilai {#comment:4}

-   **status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*.
-   **resolution** set to *fixed*.

Considering this done, the spec parser part is tracked separately in
ticket \#814 "Eliminate static buffer from spec parsing (new)".
