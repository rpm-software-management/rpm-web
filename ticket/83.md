### Description {#comment:description}

Please add the following definitions (they\'re based on Fedora and will
be used by openSUSE too) to rpm macros:

`%{!?python_sitelib: %global python_sitelib %(%{__python} -c "from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib; print get_python_lib()")}`

`%{!?python_sitearch: %global python_sitearch %(%{__python} -c "from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib; print get_python_lib(1)")}`

`%{!?python_version: %global python_version %(%{__python} -c "import sys ; print sys.version[:3]")}`

-   **status** changed from *new* to *closed*.
-   **resolution** set to *fixed*.

Done:
[http://rpm.org/gitweb?p=rpm.git;a=commitdiff;h=3e5097c97541fa0b8f289ef3b6011bdc3b4dc002](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/commit/3e5097c97541fa0b8f289ef3b6011bdc3b4dc002)
Note that construct that works in spec files doesn\'t work as is in
macro files so what\'s added is slightly different.
