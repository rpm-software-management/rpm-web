mimetype provides generator should not process all desktop files

### Description {#comment:description}

Desktop file specification says:

The [MimeType?](/MimeType) key is used to indicate the MIME Types that
an application knows how to handle. It is expected that for some
applications this list could become long. An application is expected to
be able to reasonably open files of these types using the command listed
in the Exec key.

Therefore RPM should not process all desktop files, but only the ones
that have Type=Application set. This could be further enhanced by
requiring Exec= line to be present.

I suggest the attached patch. It would also make sense to filter the
locations of \*.desktop files that are checked (so that e.g. just
example files shipped in a random location are ignored), but I don\'t
know how to make sure that valid files are not ignored by this, as
[http://standards.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/menu-spec-latest.html](http://standards.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/menu-spec-latest.html)
doesn\'t seem to provide an easy and reliable way to find all possible
locations of application desktop files.

-   **status** changed from *new* to *closed*.
-   **resolution** set to *fixed*.

Apologies for the delay\... the patch against master applied now as it
takes Exec presence into account too. Also the .desktop file locations
are now filtered in the largely rewritten, pluggable (so things like
this could actually be moved out of rpm) file classification system.

Thanks for the patches :)
