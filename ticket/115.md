create a macro for parallel make

### Description {#comment:description}

Distributions uses these macros for parallel make: - Fedora make
%{?\_smp\_mflags} - openSUSE: make %{?jobs:-j%jobs}

We could unify notation (%{?\_smp\_mflags} works on openSUSE too) and
add a definition to RPM upstream (maybe %make for parallel make and
%make\_single for single?)

-   **priority** changed from *major* to *minor*.

We should be using at least `%_smp_mflags`; the hardcoded use of
`%{?jobs:-j%jobs}` in specfiles \"forces\" the use of `-jXX`, which is
in conflict when one wants to use `-lXX` instead, for example.

("Parallel building, preferably, but I get to choose how things are
scheduled.")

`%make` and `%make_single` seems ok.

Duh, been intending to do something about this about umphteen times but
always gotten sidetracked or had second thoughts how to go about it.
Anyway, I just pushed two changes that I think solve this and some other
related issues quite nicely:

[https://rpm.org/gitweb?p=rpm.git;a=commitdiff;h=356fd73a7b24fd5fdcc093639c12dfd60f35d681](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/commit/356fd73a7b24fd5fdcc093639c12dfd60f35d681)
[https://rpm.org/gitweb?p=rpm.git;a=commitdiff;h=89df36524bace71decee4ab4f979d4ffb449c9a7](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/commit/89df36524bace71decee4ab4f979d4ffb449c9a7)

Where you previously invoked \"make\" with assorted parallel-build
magic, you now just use \"%make\_build\" which takes care of the
parallel switches. The other change is to allow specifying the maximum
numer of CPU\'s to use, which can be set on system, user or spec-level
if desireable. This allows it to be used for overall resource control in
addition to handling the special case of buggy makefiles (whether a
truly serialized build is required or parallel builds beyond some value
of N are buggy), and is nicely greppable too. So a spec might look
something like this:

    # foo-1.2 has buggy makefiles preventing parallel build
    %global _smp_ncups_max 1

    [...]

    %build
    %make_build

    %install
    %make_install

In addition to the parallel build issues, the \"make\" command to use
can be overridden with %make macro throughout the spec (previously
%make\_install honored %make but typically specs dont use that but
invoke \"make\" directly). Plus it can be enhanced for other things as
its not specific to the parallel-build issues, and should help
cross-distro unification by hiding the details from specs.

Ehm, just spotted a typo (ncups) in the above comment. The spec snippet
should of course be

    # foo-1.2 has buggy makefiles preventing parallel build
    %global _smp_ncpus_max 1

    [...]

    %build
    %make_build

    %install
    %make_install
