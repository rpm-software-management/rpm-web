## About RPM

The RPM Package Manager (RPM) is a powerful command line driven package management system capable of installing, uninstalling, verifying, querying, and updating computer software packages. Each software package consists of an archive of files along with information about the package like its version, a description, and the like. There is also a library API, permitting advanced developers to manage such transactions from programming languages such as C or Python.

RPM is [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), released under the [GPL-2.0-or-later](https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html). All of the source code in the `lib` and `rpmio` subdirectories are licensed under [GPL-2.0-or-later](https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html) OR [LGPL-2.1-or-later](https://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.1-or-later.html).

RPM is a core component of many Linux distributions, such as [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://www.redhat.com/rhel/), the [Fedora Project](https://fedoraproject.org/), [SUSE Linux Enterprise](https://www.suse.com/), [openSUSE](https://opensuse.org/), [CentOS](https://centos.org/), [Tizen](https://www.tizen.org/), [Mageia](https://mageia.org/), [CBL-Mariner](https://github.com/microsoft/CBL-Mariner) and many others.

It is also used on many other operating systems as well, and the RPM format is part of the [Linux Standard Base](https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/lsb.shtml)

RPM is quite a mature project in the OSS landscape, with first VCS
commit of the current tree dating back to 1995. As such it can be
an interesting dig site for those with a weak spot for software
archeology. Various major events from the over two decades of
project history can be found in the [timeline](timeline.html).
